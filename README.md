# Lumen Learning Infrastructure Review Exercise

## Instructions
We're interested in seeing how well you understand the components of a simple set of infrastructure components.

The `sample-infrastructure.tf` file in this repository contains some very basic infrastructure elements defined in terraform. This is a simplified example and not a complete project, but it already includes several opportunities for improvement.

Please provide some feedback on how to improve this architecture.
